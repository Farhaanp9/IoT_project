# IoT_project
This project is a real-time facial recognition system developed using Python, OpenCV, and the face_recognition library. The system captures live video feed from a webcam, detects faces in each frame, and matches them against a pre-encoded dataset of known faces. When a face is recognized, the system displays the individual's name and highlights the face with a green rectangle. If an unknown face is detected, an "INTRUDER ALERT" message is displayed. This project demonstrates the capabilities of modern computer vision and machine learning techniques for security and identification applications. The code is structured into two main scripts: encode_faces.py for encoding known faces and recognize_faces.py for performing real-time recognition.
